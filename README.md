# Latent variable models

We use the Kalman filter to infer hidden states in the context of a linear dynamical system. The linear dynamical system comes from the work of Wolpert et al. (1995), entitled "An Internal Model for Sensorimotor Integration". An important problem in sensorimotor integration is how to use sensory feedback to adjust for motor control. Wolpert et al. proposed a hypothesis that a Kalman filter can be used to mediate the process between internal motor control and sensory feedback.
