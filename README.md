# Latent variable models

We use the Kalman filter to infer hidden states in the context of linear dynamical systems. The linear dynamical system used comes from the work of Wolpert et al. (1995), entitled "An Internal Model for Sensorimotor Integration". An important problem in sensorimotor integration is how to use sensory feedback to adjust for motor control. Wolpert et al. proposed a hypothesis that
